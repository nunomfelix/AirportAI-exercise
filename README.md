## Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```

## Configuration

Before start install PostgreSQL and fill correct configurations in .env file
```bash
#if you are using docker
DB_HOST=database
DB_PORT=27017
DB_USERNAME=airportai
DB_PASSWORD=airportai
DB_DATABASE=airportai
#else 
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=27017
DB_USERNAME=airportai
DB_PASSWORD=airportai
DB_DATABASE=airportai
```

Some helper script to work with database
```bash
# To create new migration file
yarn migration:create migration_name

# Truncate full database (note: it isn't deleting the database)
yarn schema:drop

# Generate migration from update of entities
yarn migration:generate 
```
